	 - Keep in mind that each list of courses is actually a *promise* for the courses.
	 - We also need to make sure to de-duplicate the final list of courses, so that each `clbid` only appears once.
	 - Finally, remember that a given `clbid` might not exist in the database, in which case we get back 'undefined'.
	   In this case, we need to know where the `clbid` came from, so that we can render an error in the correct location.
