    message:
        In consultation with the instructor and the program director,
        concentrators may count one course not designated as an approved
        women's and gender studies course. Students who apply partial-credit
        courses towards the concentration must still complete the minimum
        number of credits. No more than one course taken elsewhere may be
        counted towards the concentration.
