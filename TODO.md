Listen to localStorage's 'storage' event to trigger re-renders when content in the database changes

I have two ideas for the credit tracking.

1. Progress bar at the very top of the `student-summary can-graduate` div. It
would be a colored progress bar much like your other progress bars around the
application.

2. The circle around the initial of the user’s first name. The progress bar
could _wrap_ around the initial much like the current border/outline does, but
instead of it being complete, it is only as far around as your progress
towards completion of credits.

Three interesting things

1. [ ] I just ran into a horrifying bug… I cannot seem to replicate it either.
I was adding a course (Hinduism) for Fall 2015 to my schedule and it didn’t
quite _add_ to my schedule. It would drag, drop, but not add. I did it several
times. I forgot to look at the log, but when I refreshed the page, my user was
deleted. Luckily I backed up my data, but I’ll be desperately trying to break
it again.

- WhereExpressions need to accomodate for multiple qualifiers.

- The courses are rendering the fully-qualified indicators on the second computation/render/pass/whatever
- They should never render the fully-qualified indicator
