Add a check to the area compiler to check for invalid requirement references

## greediness

two of (CSCI 121, 125, 241, 251)
√ X √ [√]

√ – taken, used
X - not taken
[√] - taken, not used

Get rid of the pure gray results.

Make them green, half-transparent green, or transparent red.

For "taken and used", "taken, not used" and "not taken".

dirty checking is still going to be tricky for Math

> No, because I can take my transition courses and they count towards perspectives.
> Some courses have multiple perspectives that can't be used

add rendering for filters

like,
if it's not needed by anything else, then go ahead and check it
but if it's used for something else, then don't?

map courses to uses {
ART 234: [Studio Art > 3D Media > Ceramics, Art History > Other Requirement]
}

we're holding on to the old evaluated areas of study in the history of the student object. they're really big.

## Where expressions

WhereExpressions need to accomodate for multiple qualifiers.

- The courses are rendering the fully-qualified indicators on the second computation/render/pass/whatever
- They should never render the fully-qualified indicator

## Semester 0

> semester '0' is year-long

it's actually a temporary term for abroad programs. it's broken up into the actual
semesters once the program is over.

## Non-major Majors

"Students must declare a major by fall semester of the junior year.""

(also should add a blank file for "Individual Major")

## Exceptional Courses

They show up in the middle of semesters.

## "At Most" queries

> 6 electives. At most 2 may be level 2.

> No level 1 are required. Up to 3 L1 may count, but no more than 2 seminars.

> 10 math courses, that is, 7 excluding Basics, of which at most 2 may be outside of MATH.

> At most 2 level 1 BIO courses.

Collect courses up to the limit, then return. Remove any other matches from the list.
