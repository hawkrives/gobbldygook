	// NOTE: Ignored, because we don't store s/u status.

	// At least 50 percent of the minimum major must be taken through St.
	// Olaf. Students should consult the registrar and the department chair or
	// program director about counting toward a major courses taken at other
	// colleges. In addition to the registrar, the chair must sign the
	// studentâ€™s transfer of credit form (available from the Office of the
	// Registrar and Academic Advising) if work from other institutions is
	// accepted in advance. Likewise, courses taken through St. Olaf off-
	// campus programs must be approved by the chair or director and the off-
	// campus program advisor in advance if credit toward a major is sought.
