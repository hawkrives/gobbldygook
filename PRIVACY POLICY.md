# PRIVACY POLICY

Your personal data does not leave your web browser, unless you explicitly export
it as a file.

We have no access to your St. Olaf account, other than what you provide. We only
know what you tell us.

At some future time, we may allow you to store your data in Google Drive. If
this happens, and you wish to utilize the feature, you will need to link your
St. Olaf account to Gobbldygook. We will not store your password in any way.

We currently implement Google Analytics. It is used for two purposes:

1. To track the number of users of Gobbldygook
2. To track what courses students are searching for

You will soon be able to turn off the analytics script; however, like the rest
of the data, that setting will not leave your web browser.
