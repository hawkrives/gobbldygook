This is a course scheduler for students at St. Olaf College. You give it your areas of study (majors, concentrations, degrees), the courses you *have* taken and are *planning* on taking, and it tells you if you can graduate or not.

We have a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/cviTwkre) where we track which areas of study we are working on; if you have one in particular that you want us to work on next, let us know by either voting on the Trello card or emailing us!


## Playing
1. Visit https://stolaf.edu/people/rives/g
    – Gobbldygook currently supports every major browser, except for Safari (so Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, and Microsoft Edge). (Addendum: IE support is currently broken. Unsure why. It's on the TODO list.)
    – Let's just say that Safari's database support is … a bit lacking.
    – On iOS devices, every browser is required to use Safari internally, which means that Chrome, Opera, and Safari on iOS all have the same terrible database support.
    – In short: you can't use Safari, iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch to access Gobbldygook. :-(

2. Push "New Student": you can either choose to import your data from the SIS, write down your information manually, or import a previously-exported student file.

3. Search for the courses you have taken and are planning on taking, and drag them into the appropriate semesters.
    – Make sure to choose the right offering for each semester!
    – If you use the "search" button on a semester, it will automatically limit your search to just that semester, which might be helpful.
