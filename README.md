This is a course scheduler for students at St. Olaf College. You give it your areas of study (majors, concentrations, degrees), the courses you _have_ taken and are _planning_ to take, and it tells you if you can graduate or not.

We have a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/cviTwkre) where we track which areas of study we are working on; if you have one in particular that you want us to work on next, let us know by either voting on the Trello card or emailing us!

## Playing

1. Visit [https://gobbldygook.site](https://gobbldygook.site)
   – Gobbldygook currently supports every major browser, except for IE (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari 10+, and Microsoft Edge).

2. Push "New Student": you can either choose to import your data from the SIS, write down your information manually, or import a previously-exported student file.

3. Search for the courses you have taken and are planning on taking, and drag them into the appropriate semesters.
   – Make sure to choose the right offering for each semester!
   – If you use the "search" button on a semester, it will automatically limit your search to just that semester, which might be helpful.
